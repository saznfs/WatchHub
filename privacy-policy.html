	<h2>DATA TRACKING COOKIES</h2>
	<p>To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. 
	A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes and contains information about that User. 
	We use cookies to save your time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. 
	Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, such as which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. 
	This information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. Additionally, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website. 
	As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. 
	This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. 
	Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies.

	<h2>SERVER LOGS</h2>
	<p>In an effort to make our Website as effective and enjoyable as possible, the computers that operate it collect certain information each time you visit. 
	We store these statistics in server logs. Once again, these statistics do not identify you personally, but provide us with information regarding the type of user who is accessing our Website and certain browsing activities of that user. 
	This data may include: the IP address of the user accessing our Website (i.e., the unique ID number of the user's computer), the type of browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.) 
	and the operating system (Windows, Mac OS, etc.), the Website the user last visited before linking to our Website, how long the user accessed our Website in any given session, and the date and time of access. 
	We may make extensive use of this data at an aggregated level to understand how our Website is being used. 
	We may share some of the aggregate findings (not the specific data) with advertisers, sponsors, investors, strategic partners, and others in order to help grow our business.
	</p>
	
	<h2>PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</h2>
	<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. 
	Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices. 
	If you link to any such website, we urge you to review the respective website's privacy policy.

	The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted on the Website. 
	It is the responsibility of each User to review the Website and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy. 
	Your continued use of the Website after the effectiveness of such revisions will constitute your acknowledgment and acceptance of the terms of the revised Privacy Policy. 
	We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.
